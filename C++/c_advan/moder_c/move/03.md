the move constructor and the move assignment operator
class Widget{
    public:
        Widget(Widget&&)noexcept;
        Widget &operator=(Widget&&)noexpet;
}
move operators should be noexcept in most cases



the resource owned by the move-form object are stolen in move operations
template<typename T>
class Array{
    std::size_t m_size;
    T*m_data;
    public:
    //noexcept通知编译器 我这个是安全的，你优先选择右值
        Array(Array &&other)noexcept:m_size(other.m_size),m_data(other.m_data){
            other.m_size=0;
            other.m_data=nullptr;
        }
}
obtain the resources directly instead of making a copy
make sure the move-from object is in a valid state and can be safely destroyed 
确定被move的对象可被
